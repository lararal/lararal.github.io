                <p>
                    Lara is from Niterói (Rio de Janeiro state) but learned how to dance forró in the various forró parties during her time living in São José dos Campos (São Paulo state) where she went for college. Though she studied (and still studies) other Brazilian social dances such as Samba de Gafieira, Bolero and Brazilian Zouk, her favorite is, and always will be, Forró. She started teaching in São José dos Campos at her university and even taught it for one year when she was living in South Korea. After she came to Seattle, she was waiting for someone else to come and start teaching until she realized that she was that person. Lara dances and teaches as lead and follow and she sometimes gets to teach at forró festivals in the US.

                    Marcio Marques dos Santos, born and raised in Brazil, has been practicing and teaching Capoeira, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and Brazilian Dances for more than a decade. He is excited to share his experience, energy, and love of Brazilian arts with Seattle.<br /><br />

                    Kimberly Langland, born and raised in Seattle, fell in love with the Brazilian dance Lambada in 2012 and from there has developed a great appreciation for the joyful energy of brazililan arts and culture. She is delighted to partner with Marcio to bring the Brazilian spirit to her home town.
